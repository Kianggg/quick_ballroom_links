WHAT:</br>
This is a website made to compile a bunch of useful information and links for collegiate ballroom dancers.
On this site, users may look up their individual competition results (using data from a website called o2cm, which is infamously difficult to navigate).
They may also view useful information about the YCN "points" system and entries for upcoming competitons.
One of the best parts of the site is the "dance syllabus."
This is a list of legal dance moves that one may perform in competition.
Each figure will be accompanied by a gif that shows how the figure is danced.
As there are hundreds of figures, this is still a work in progress.
Right now, there's just a running Pikachu. It is a placeholder.
That said, I am very excited about this project and I aim to film the remaining three styles of dance figures over the break.
This could be an amazing resource for newer dancers!

HOW:</br>
This is a dynamic website created using Flask, Jinja, and Python, as in the final problem set of this class.
Currently, it is not hosted anywhere, so to view the project, one must run Flask from the command line.
To do this, unzip the folder, then navigate to the opened folder in the terminal.
Execute:
venv/Scripts/activate
Then execute:
flask run

This should allow one to click on the resultant link and view the website in their browser of choice.

    Notes:
        - Python is required.
        - Flask must also be installed.

Click on the links on the homepage or use the navbar to navigate the site.
"Dance Syllabi" leads to a page with 19 buttons, one for each of the 19 dances.
Currently, only the first 4 are complete.
Clicking on one of these buttons will lead to a page that displays Bronze-level and Silver-level figures.
Click on one of those buttons to view the instructional gif.
